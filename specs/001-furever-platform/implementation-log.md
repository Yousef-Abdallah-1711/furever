# Implementation Log — FurEver Platform (specs/001-furever-platform)

Delegation model: OpenAI Codex CLI (`gpt-6-luna`, effort `high`, service_tier `priority` via ambient
`~/.codex/config.toml`), orchestrated through the `codex-delegate` skill (`relay.mjs`). The orchestrator
(Claude Code) never writes implementation code — it writes briefs, dispatches, reviews diffs, re-runs
gates, and commits.

Columns: Task ID | Worker | Retries | Commands run (orchestrator's own re-verification) | Result | Commit

## D00a — Repo and tooling

| Task | Worker | Retries | Commands run | Result | Commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T001 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high) | 0 | Independent re-fetch of expo.dev/changelog/sdk-58 and reactnative.dev/versions to confirm Codex's own flagged contradiction | PASS, with a human decision recorded below | be51738 |
| T002 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high) | 1 | `node -e "JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(...))"` on all 7 package.json + raw-byte BOM/CRLF check on all 8 files | PASS after 1 retry (BOM + CRLF fixed) | 3e7b5e7 |
| T003 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high), parallel batch of 3 | 0 | Raw-byte check (no BOM/CRLF); content match against task text | PASS | (pending) |
| T004 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high), parallel batch of 3 | 0 | `JSON.parse` + raw-byte check; confirmed "tasks" (not "pipeline") is current Turborepo key | PASS | (pending) |
| T005 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high), parallel batch of 3 | 0 | `JSON.parse` + raw-byte check; separately dispatched a read-only Codex check against Biome's own docs to confirm `linter.rules.preset` and `!!` force-ignore glob syntax are real (not invented) schema keys | PASS | (pending) |

**Decision recorded (2026-10-19, T001)**: Expo's current stable SDK (58) bundles React Native 0.88,
which upstream reactnative.dev still lists as "Future" (release-candidate, not tagged stable); NativeWind's
stable 4.2.7 docs confirm SDK 57 support only, not SDK 58 explicitly. Independently re-verified via direct
fetch of expo.dev/changelog/sdk-58 (confirms: "SDK 58 upgrades React Native from 0.86 to 0.88... picks up
the changes from both React Native 0.87 and the React Native 0.88 release candidate") — this is a real
state of the two upstream projects, not a Codex error. **User decision**: pin Expo SDK 58 as-is (apps
pin the Expo SDK number, not React Native directly; Expo's own fork/patches are what actually ships) —
caveats documented in `COMPATIBILITY.md`'s "Compatibility finding" and "Source details and limitations"
sections. No further action needed before T002.
