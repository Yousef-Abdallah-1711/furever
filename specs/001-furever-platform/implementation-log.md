# Implementation Log — FurEver Platform (specs/001-furever-platform)

Delegation model: OpenAI Codex CLI (`gpt-6-luna`, effort `high`, service_tier `priority` via ambient
`~/.codex/config.toml`), orchestrated through the `codex-delegate` skill (`relay.mjs`). The orchestrator
(Claude Code) never writes implementation code — it writes briefs, dispatches, reviews diffs, re-runs
gates, and commits.

Columns: Task ID | Worker | Retries | Commands run (orchestrator's own re-verification) | Result | Commit

## Doc changes needed

- **plan.md Project Structure vs. T060 (D00e)**: plan.md's target tree lists only
  `design/system/{tokens,components,ui_kits,guidelines}` (matching T011's own task text exactly), but
  T060 references `design/system/_adherence.oxlintrc.json` — a root-level file in the SOURCE folder
  (`FurEver Design System/_adherence.oxlintrc.json`), not under any of those four subdirectories. T011
  (this pass) copies only the four subdirs it's asked for, per its own text — the original
  `FurEver Design System/` folder is left in place (T011 never says to delete/move the source), so
  tasks that read straight from the original root path (e.g. T034 reads
  `FurEver Design System/guidelines/screen-inventory.md` directly) are unaffected. **Action needed when
  D00e/T060 is reached**: either copy `_adherence.oxlintrc.json` into `design/system/` at that point, or
  change T060's lint rule to read it from the original `FurEver Design System/` path instead. Not
  blocking now; flagged for whoever picks up D00e.

## D00a — Repo and tooling

| Task | Worker | Retries | Commands run | Result | Commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T001 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high) | 0 | Independent re-fetch of expo.dev/changelog/sdk-58 and reactnative.dev/versions to confirm Codex's own flagged contradiction | PASS, with a human decision recorded below | be51738 |
| T002 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high) | 1 | `node -e "JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(...))"` on all 7 package.json + raw-byte BOM/CRLF check on all 8 files | PASS after 1 retry (BOM + CRLF fixed) | 3e7b5e7 |
| T003 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high), parallel batch of 3 | 0 | Raw-byte check (no BOM/CRLF); content match against task text | PASS | (pending) |
| T004 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high), parallel batch of 3 | 0 | `JSON.parse` + raw-byte check; confirmed "tasks" (not "pipeline") is current Turborepo key | PASS | (pending) |
| T005 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high), parallel batch of 3 | 0 | `JSON.parse` + raw-byte check; separately dispatched a read-only Codex check against Biome's own docs to confirm `linter.rules.preset` and `!!` force-ignore glob syntax are real (not invented) schema keys | PASS | (pending) |
| T006 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high), parallel batch of 3 | 0 | `JSON.parse` + raw-byte check on all 5 tsconfig.json files; resolved each `extends` path in Node to confirm it points at the real root tsconfig.json | PASS (Codex also self-corrected a path error in my own brief: `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` needs `../../tsconfig.json`, not `../tsconfig.json`) | (pending) |
| T007 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high), parallel batch of 3 | 0 | Raw-byte check (no BOM/CRLF); content match | PASS | (pending) |
| T008 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high), parallel batch of 3 | 0 | Raw-byte check; confirmed exact required line `* text=auto eol=lf` present | PASS | (pending) |
| T009 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high) | 0 | `node --check` on both JS configs; raw-byte check; `git ls-files -s` on the husky hook | PASS, with one orchestrator-side fix (not sent back to Codex): `.husky/commit-msg` had no executable bit (`-rw-r--r--`) — git hooks silently don't run without it on Linux/macOS/CI. `core.filemode=false` on this Windows checkout, so `chmod` was a no-op; fixed via `git update-index --chmod=+x` to force mode 100755 in the git index/commit directly | 730142d |
| T010 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high) | 0 | SHA-256 + byte-length comparison between the root PRD and `docs/PRD.md` (Node, independent of Codex's self-report) | PASS, byte-identical (106,085 bytes, same SHA-256) | (pending) |
| T011 | codex (gpt-6-luna, effort high) | 0 | Recursive per-file SHA-256 comparison (Node script, path-aware) between `FurEver Design System/{tokens,components,ui_kits,guidelines}` and `design/system/{...}`; confirmed `design/overrides.md` untouched | PASS, 5/56/19/9 files all match | (pending) |

**Decision recorded (2026-10-19, T001)**: Expo's current stable SDK (58) bundles React Native 0.88,
which upstream reactnative.dev still lists as "Future" (release-candidate, not tagged stable); NativeWind's
stable 4.2.7 docs confirm SDK 57 support only, not SDK 58 explicitly. Independently re-verified via direct
fetch of expo.dev/changelog/sdk-58 (confirms: "SDK 58 upgrades React Native from 0.86 to 0.88... picks up
the changes from both React Native 0.87 and the React Native 0.88 release candidate") — this is a real
state of the two upstream projects, not a Codex error. **User decision**: pin Expo SDK 58 as-is (apps
pin the Expo SDK number, not React Native directly; Expo's own fork/patches are what actually ships) —
caveats documented in `COMPATIBILITY.md`'s "Compatibility finding" and "Source details and limitations"
sections. No further action needed before T002.
